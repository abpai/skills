description: Generate a beautiful standalone HTML diagram and open it in the browser
---
Load the visual-explainer skill, then generate an HTML diagram for: $@

Follow the visual-explainer skill workflow. Read the reference template and CSS patterns before generating. Use the editorial design system (white bg, Merriweather headings, Inter body). Vary the tint color.

If the request is an execution flow, code flow, pipeline flow, or step chain, render it as a flowchart through the Excalidraw pipeline (not Mermaid-only).

If `surf` CLI is available (`which surf`), consider generating an AI illustration via `surf gemini --generate-image` when an image would genuinely enhance the page — a hero banner, conceptual illustration, or educational diagram that Mermaid can't express. Match the image style to the page's palette. Embed as base64 data URI. See css-patterns.md "Generated Images" for container styles. Skip images when the topic is purely structural or data-driven.

Write to `~/.agent/diagrams/` and open the result in the browser.
