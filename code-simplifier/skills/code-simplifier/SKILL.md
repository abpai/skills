# Code Simplifier

Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then simplify and fix any issues found.

## Core Rules

1. Preserve functionality exactly.
1. Keep public behavior, outputs, side effects, and interfaces unchanged.
1. Follow project-specific coding standards and patterns.
1. Prefer clarity over compactness.
1. Avoid clever rewrites that reduce debuggability.

## Scope

- Default to the current task's changed files.
- Focus on code the user just changed or that you changed in this conversation.
- Keep fixes behavior-preserving unless the user explicitly asked for broader refactors.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

1. Run `git diff`.
1. If there are staged changes, prefer `git diff HEAD` so staged and unstaged edits are both visible.
1. If there are no git changes, inspect the most recently modified files relevant to the task.

## Phase 2: Run Three Reviews In Parallel

If subagents are available, launch all three review agents concurrently in a single round and pass each agent the full diff.

If subagents are not available, perform the same three review passes yourself.

Launch all three review agents in the same message. Give each agent the full diff so it can reason about the whole change, not just one file in isolation.

### Review 1: Code Reuse Review

Check whether the change reimplements logic that already exists.

- Search for existing helpers, utilities, and shared abstractions that could replace new code.
- Look in utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the changed code.
- Flag new functions that duplicate existing behavior.
- Flag inline logic that should use an existing utility instead of hand-rolled code.
- Common duplication targets include string manipulation, path handling, env detection, parsing helpers, and type guards.

### Review 2: Code Quality Review

Check for structural and maintainability issues.

- Redundant state: duplicated state, cached values that could be derived, effects that could be direct calls.
- Parameter sprawl: new parameters added where restructuring or generalization would be cleaner.
- Copy-paste variation: near-duplicate blocks that should share an abstraction.
- Leaky abstractions: exposing internal details or breaking module boundaries.
- Stringly-typed code: raw strings where constants, unions, or existing types should be used.
- Unnecessary JSX nesting: wrapper elements that add no layout or semantic value.
- Unnecessary nesting and branching complexity.
- Unclear identifiers that obscure intent.
- Dense logic that should be split into coherent, single-purpose helpers.
- Fragile one-liners that should be explicit, readable control flow.
- Unnecessary comments: remove comments that only restate what the code does; keep only non-obvious why.

### Review 3: Efficiency Review

Check for unnecessary work and avoidable overhead.

- Unnecessary work: redundant computation, repeated file reads, duplicate API calls, N+1 patterns.
- Missed concurrency: independent work done sequentially when it could run in parallel.
- Hot-path bloat: new blocking work in startup, render, request, or polling paths.
- Recurring no-op updates: state or store writes that fire even when nothing changed; ensure wrapper updaters preserve no-change signals when a same-reference return should short-circuit downstream updates.
- Unnecessary existence checks: prefer operating directly and handling errors over TOCTOU pre-checks.
- Memory issues: unbounded collections, missing cleanup, leaked listeners or subscriptions.
- Overly broad operations: reading or loading more data than needed.

## Phase 3: Simplify and Fix

1. Aggregate the findings from all three review passes.
1. Fix each worthwhile issue directly.
1. If a finding is a false positive or not worth changing, skip it without debate.
1. Re-check the edited code for correctness and local consistency.
1. Run available lint, test, or targeted validation when practical.
1. Briefly summarize what you fixed, what you skipped, and whether the reviewed code was already clean.

## Boundaries

Do not:

- Change business logic or edge-case behavior.
- Alter API contracts, data formats, or error semantics unless requested.
- Expand scope beyond recently touched code unless explicitly requested.
- Over-normalize style at the expense of local codebase conventions.

## Decision Heuristics

- If two versions are equivalent, choose the one a new teammate can understand fastest.
- Keep useful abstractions; remove only those that add indirection without value.
- Prefer straightforward flow over reduced line count.
- Stop when readability gains flatten out.

## Output

When finished, briefly summarize:

- what you fixed
- what you intentionally skipped
- whether the reviewed code was already clean
