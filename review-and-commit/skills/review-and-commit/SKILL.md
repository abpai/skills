description: Review uncommitted Git changes for correctness, quality, and project convention alignment, then apply fixes and prepare a safe, atomic commit plan. Use when users ask to review code before committing, improve local changes, split work into logical conventional commits, or execute `git add`/`git commit` with clear staging boundaries.

# Code Review and Commit

Perform a high-signal review of working-tree changes, fix meaningful issues, and produce an understandable commit history.

Source basis: adapted from a local Claude Code agent prompt (`review-and-commit.md`).

## Working tree (preflight)

```!
echo "REVIEW_COMMIT_PREFLIGHT_$(date +%s%N)"
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "not a git repo"
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
git status --short 2>/dev/null | head -40
git diff --stat 2>/dev/null | head -20
git diff --cached --stat 2>/dev/null | head -20
git log --oneline -n 5 2>/dev/null
```

The block above runs at skill-load time. Treat it as ground truth for the
initial "Inspect Current Change Scope" step. Defer full `git diff` bodies to
explicit Read/Bash calls where you need more than the stat summary.

## Workflow

1. Inspect current change scope.
1. Review for correctness and maintainability issues.
1. Apply necessary fixes.
1. Validate updated changes.
1. Build a commit plan.
1. Ask for approval before creating commits.
1. Execute commits in order and report results.

## 1) Inspect Current Change Scope

Run:

- `git status --short`
- `git diff` (unstaged)
- `git diff --staged` (if relevant)

Map changes by concern (feature, fix, refactor, tests, docs) before suggesting commit boundaries.

## 2) Review Priorities

Prioritize in this order:

1. Correctness and regressions.
1. Security and secret leakage risks.
1. Broken architecture or project-pattern violations.
1. Missing tests for behavior changes.
1. Readability and maintainability improvements.

Review for:

- Logic bugs and unhandled edge cases.
- Missing error handling or validation.
- Performance pitfalls in changed code paths.
- Type accuracy and docstring quality; favor concise, useful docs.
- Low-value comments that restate obvious code behavior.
- Resource-lifecycle problems (cleanup, context management).
- Violations of repository conventions from project docs.

## 3) Apply Fixes

When findings are actionable and safe, implement fixes directly.

- Keep scope tight to the requested work.
- Avoid unrelated refactors unless necessary for correctness.
- Re-check diffs after each meaningful fix.

## 4) Validate

Run relevant quality checks when available (for example lint, tests, type checks).

If checks cannot run, explicitly state what was skipped and why.

## 5) Build Commit Plan

Group changes into atomic commits that can be reverted independently.

For each proposed commit include:

- Commit type and summary (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`).
- Exact files to stage.
- Why this grouping is coherent.
- Final commit message draft.

Commit message rules:

- Use imperative mood.
- Keep subject concise (target <= 50 chars).
- Add body only when needed, explaining why.
- Wrap body lines near 72 chars.

## 6) Approval Gate

Before running `git add` or `git commit`, present the full commit plan and request approval.

If the user asks for changes, revise the plan and re-present before executing.

## 7) Execute and Report

After approval:

1. Stage only planned files for the current commit.
1. Create the commit.
1. Confirm success with commit hash and summary.
1. Repeat for remaining commits.

End with a concise recap:

- Commits created (hash + subject).
- Files included per commit.
- Any remaining unstaged/uncommitted changes.

## Output Format

Use this structure:

1. `Review Findings` grouped by severity (`Critical`, `Important`, `Suggestion`).
1. `Applied Fixes` with file-level summary.
1. `Validation Results` (commands run and outcomes).
1. `Proposed Commit Plan` (numbered commits with file list + message).
1. `Execution Results` after approval.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer correctness over style.
- Favor project conventions over personal preference.
- Surface trade-offs when multiple valid approaches exist.
- Escalate explicitly when changes are risky or architecture-affecting.

## Update Check

On first use in a session, silently check for a newer version:

1. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abpai/skills/main/versions.json`.
2. Compare the version for `review-and-commit` against this file's `metadata.version`.
3. If the remote version is newer, pause before the main task and ask:
   > **review-and-commit** update available (local {X.Y} → remote {A.B}).
   > Would you like me to update it for you first?
   > I can run `npx skills update review-and-commit` for you.
4. If the user says yes, run the update before continuing.
5. If the user says no, continue with the current local version.
6. If the fetch fails or web access is unavailable, skip silently.
